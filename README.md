## Literature Review

Rogers, Everett M. *Diffusion of innovations.* New York: Free Press, 2005.  
HM 101 .R57 1995
303.484 R

Everett explores what are the factors that promote the adoption and proliferation of ideas and technology and what are the choke points that prevent people from embracing these innovations. Everett posits that ultimately, the process of diffusing ideas is a social process, heavily reliant on social networks, which ultimately yields cultural change.
1.	How does this process work exactly?
2.	Are some networks more successful than others at disseminating change? Are some ideas more amenable to diffusion?
3.  What are the other models? Have there been any recent developments that might overturn this theory?

Axelrod, Robert M. *The complexity of cooperation: Agent-based models of competition and collaboration*. Princeton University Press, 1997. 
HM131 .A894 1997
302.14-dc21

The *Complexity of Cooperation* is a follow up to the author's previous work, *The Evolution of Cooperation*. In the first work, Axelrod explored how a simple thought experiment known as the Prisoner's Dilemma, could explain how cooperation between individuals develops. In his follow up work, the author posits that social interactions are much more complex than this two player game and he explores other games and models for explaining complex social structures. 
1. Axelrod explains that his first work was a product of the Cold War. What are the implications for this latter work? Is there some other model that's out there that's more relevant to *our* times?
2. Axelrod cites the many applications of the Prisoner's Dilemma  conducted by other researchers, such as the behaviors of fish, bacterium and banks. What are some of the applications of the complexity models? Do these model fit within a historical context? (i.e. do we now understand how civilization developed???)

Bierman, H. Scott, and Luis Florentin Fernandez. *Game theory with economic applications.* Addison Wesley, 1998. 
HB144 .B54 1993 
330.015

This is a basic textbook introducing game theory; the theory distills the complex underpinnings of economic behaviors to the basic relationship between individuals â€“ how does the decision of one affect the many? The ways in which people strategize the decisions of their peers constitutes the basics of the game, or our entire social and economic structure. This book provides an overview of how people make decisions and what are the economic applications of these strategic decisions.
1. The book focuses on non-cooperative games. How does the theory hold up with cooperative games?
2. What are the non-economic applications of this theory?

Ross, Ian Simpson, ed. On the wealth of nations: contemporary responses to Adam Smith. No. 19. Thoemmes Pr, 1998.  
HB 161 .05 1998
330.153 

*On the Wealth of Nations* is a compilation of contemporary essays responding Adam Smith's *Wealth of Nations*. Now considered to be one of the seminal works on economics, this was how the book was first received. 
1. Do the essays contained reflect the diffusion of ideas?
2.
