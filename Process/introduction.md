### An Intorduction to Game Theory
#### MSDV Thesis

---

**Context:** 
Game theory can be a tool that can help users make more rational or strategic decisions.

**Problem:** 
1. Game theory is hard to access - a lot of formulas
2. Is game theory stuck in the past - or is this a misconception?

**Solution:** Visualization of games and recontextualization to make the games and strategies clearer to readers so that they can better apply them to their own lives.

1. What is game theory?
  a. History (Von Neumann, Nash, Axelrod)
  b. What’s it good for? (Practical applications)
  c. Strategies and Equilibria
  d. Normalized forms and Decision Trees
  e. (A short) history of visualizations in game theory
2. Prisoner’s Dilemma, Chicken (Hawk-Dove/Snowdrift), Stag Hung
  a. Description
  b. History
  c. Practical applications
  d. Normalized form
  e. Nash equilibrium
3. Repeated Games
  a. Shadow of future
  b. Basin of attraction
  c. Folk Theorem (?)
4. Evolutionary Game Theory
  a. History (Maynard-Smith, Dawkins)
  b. Axelrod Tournaments and simulated strategies
     i. Grim Trigger
     ii. Tit-for-tat]
     iii. Pavlov


**Personal problems:** 
I no longer talk at all about cooperation which is what got me interested in this topic to begin with…

Am I formulating the right problem? Is this an interesting enough problem??

Within this problem/solution formula, I don’t really think there is room for the Moore environment matrix. I’m not sure ESS works either…

**Context:** Social dilemmas are situations where the wishes of the individual stand in opposition to the larger social good. Game theory has been used to highlight these real-world tensions, and provide possible explanations for how cooperation develops between individuals with competing motivations.

**Problem:** Traditionally, the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Hawk-Dove game have been studied to simulate the evolution of cooperation. Both these games, though, reflect games where defection is more tempting than mutual cooperation. The Stag Hunt game is less studied and presents a game where mutual cooperation is more tempting than defection and yet is a less stable strategy. Do the same findings on the successful strategies for the PD and HD games apply to the Stag Hunt game or do different patterns emerge?

**Solution:** I will apply the strategies popularized by Axelrod in the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma and Maynard-Smith/Dawkins for the Hawk-Dove game and see how they fare in the Stag Hunt game.
