### Topic: I am studying different models in game theory to explain cooperation
Questions: 

because I want to find out whether this theory can be used to explain donor behavior 

  	problem: in order to give readers the tools to gather better donations

	problem: in order to give donors the resources to make better donation decisions

because I want to see if democracies are inherently stable cooperative structures

	problem: in order to give readers a better expectation of how long our democratic age will last

problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of how their own actions might have larger impacts 

	problem: in order to give readers an understanding of historical developments 

because I want to understand all the different models for mapping/predicting cooperative behavior 

```problem: in order to give readers an understanding on the factors that go into building complex social structures

Questions: 

because I want to learn if this theory can explain the why foreign aid is often misguided

```problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of which types of programs/technologies to fund

problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of which methods of distribution would be most effective```

because I want to understand if the spread of ideas was more reliant on travel or network channels

```problem: in order to better understand the role of religion in diffusion networks```
   
because I want to understand why some ideas take off and others do not

```problem: in order to give readers resources for successfully spreading ideas```

because I want to learn if this theory can explain the diffusion of farming throughout ancient civilizations (mesopotamia, south america, indus valley) 

```problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of the factors at play for establishing basic fundamentals of civilization```
