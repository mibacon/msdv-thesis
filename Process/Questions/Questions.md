## First what is game theory? 
"The study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers" 
"The primary use of game theory is to describe and model[ [and predict] how human populations behave."

## Second, what is evolutionary game theory?
"defines a framework of contests, strategies, and analytics into which Darwinian competition can be modelled."
does not assume rationality of participants


## Topic: I am studying evolutionary game theory and its role in explaining cooperation and altruism
Questions:

because I want to understand all the different models for mapping/predicting cooperative/altruistic behavior
  * problem: in order to give readers an understanding on the factors that go into building complex social structures 
  * problem: in order to give readers an understanding on crucial or non-essential elements in social structures (e.g. you can eliminate the police but not the clergy?) 
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of what keeps our current civilizations from devolving

because I want to understand how environment effects populations' ability/willingness to cooperate
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of how their own backgrounds contribute to their own or their neighbors' behavior
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of the factors that went into play to creating their current culture and norms

because I want to understand if there is a new model to reflect the post-cold war, post-collaborative eras of the 20th century (or other non-Western cultures)
  * problem:  in order to give readers a sense of other organizing/political options available (possibly on the horizon)

because I want to understand how the individual impacts the communal
  * problem: in order to give readers an understanding of historical developments
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of how their own actions might have larger impacts

because I want to understand how altruism and norms develop, how they control society and who benefits the most from their perpetuation
  * problem: in order to give readers the tools to question their own societal norms
  * problem: in order to give readers the tools to question who benefits from their societal norms

because I want to understand how collaboration and complicity develops in autocratic states
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of their own possible complicity in wrongdoing
  * problem: in order to give readers tools to resisting complicity with wrongdoing

## Topic: I am studying the network based theory of the diffusion of ideas
Questions:

because I want to understand why some ideas take off and others do not
  * problem: in order to give readers resources for successfully spreading ideas

because I want to learn if this theory can explain the why foreign aid is often misguided
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of which types of programs/technologies to fund
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of which methods of distribution would be most effective

because I want to understand if the spread of ideas was more reliant on travel or network channels
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of pre-modern communication patterns

because I want to learn if this theory can explain the distribution of Aristotelian thought via Muslim texts
  * problem: in order to better understand the role of religion in diffusion networks

because I want to learn if this theory can explain the diffusion of farming throughout ancient civilizations (mesopotamia, south america, indus valley)
  * problem: in order to give readers a better understanding of the factors at play for establishing basic fundamentals of civilization
